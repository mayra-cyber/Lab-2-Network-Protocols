# Lab 2 — Network Protocols & Internet Communication

## Objective
Understand how data moves across networks and how core internet protocols support communication, security, and reliability.

## Environment
- Host OS: Windows 11
- Network Type: LAN

## Protocols Studied

| Category | Protocols |
|--------|----------|
| Web | HTTP, HTTPS |
| File Transfer | FTP, FTPS, SFTP |
| Email | SMTP, POP3, IMAP |
| Network Services | DNS, DHCP, NTP |
| Remote Access | SSH, Telnet |
| Transport | TCP, UDP |
| Network Operations | ARP, ICMP |
| Network Management | SNMP |
| Routing | RIP, OSPF |

## What I Learned

- HTTP and HTTPS control how browsers request pages from servers, with HTTPS providing encryption.
- FTP allows file transfers but lacks encryption, while FTPS and SFTP are secure alternatives.
- SMTP sends emails, POP3 and IMAP retrieve them.
- DHCP assigns IP addresses and DNS resolves domain names.
- NTP synchronizes time across systems.
- SSH enables encrypted remote access, while Telnet does not.
- TCP ensures reliable delivery; UDP prioritizes speed.
- ARP maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.
- ICMP supports diagnostics like ping and traceroute.
- SNMP monitors network devices.
- RIP and OSPF control routing paths.

## Why This Matters in Cybersecurity

These protocols are the foundation of network monitoring, incident response, and security operations.

## Reflection

Understanding network protocols helped me see how devices, servers, and users communicate behind the scenes. This knowledge is critical for detecting attacks, troubleshooting issues, and securing modern networks.
